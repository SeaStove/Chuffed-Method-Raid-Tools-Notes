[How to add a note](https://imgur.com/gallery/ejGGJtu)

Highly recommend using [MRT Notes](https://mrt-notes.vercel.app/playground) for any bulk note editing.

1. These are SUPER SIMPLIFIED and OPINIONATED notes. They are meant to give you a quick overview of what to do in the fight. Being opinionated saves a lot of space which is at a premium with onscreen notes. Them being opinionated also means they'll likely be updated / changed as the raid goes on as people discover more optimal strategies.
2. Each boss has a folder that contains All Roles, Heroic, or Normal notes. Heroic and Normal notes change dynamically depending on your class / role. So if you are a healer you will see extra notes for healers, if you are DPS you won't see Tank notes, etc. If you want to see all the notes regardless of your role, choose the "All Roles" file.
3. AFAIK there isn't a good way to mass import notes to MRT. You will have to copy paste in each one. (PS if the authors of MRT happen to see this I'd love to help code some features in the notes section!!)
4. If you have any suggestions or if the guides are wrong in any way, I'd really appreciate it if you made an "Issue" in Github! Or a pull request with the fix would be even nicer.

I am keeping the notes in a Github repo for a few reasons:

1. MRT doesn't have a history or undo function AFAIK, so I wrote these offline then just verified them in game. Deleted too many notes on accident prior to this lol.
2. I'd love for these to be community driven. If anyone has any suggestions or improvements, they can just do a pull request or create an issue.
3. This will be a go to resource for all future raids as well.

FAQ:

- Q: I hate these colors
- A: All the colors used are found in FormattingGuide.txt, if there's any you want to change, you can open the note (or all notes) in your favorite text editor and find-replace those colors.
